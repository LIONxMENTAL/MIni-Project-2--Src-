This is a number guessing game where the program randomly selects an integer between 1 and 100, and the user is prompted to guess the number. The game proceeds as follows:

1. **Random Number Generation:** The program generates a random number `n` between 1 and 100.
2. **User Input:** The user is asked to input a guess (`a`) through the console.
3. **Comparison:** 
   - If the guessed number (`a`) is greater than the generated number (`n`), the program prompts the user to "Choose a lower number."
   - If the guessed number is less than the generated number, the program prompts the user to "Choose a higher number."
4. **Looping:** The game continues to prompt the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
5. **Game Completion:** When the user guesses the correct number, the program prints a message indicating the correct number and the total number of guesses made.

This simple game helps the user practice their number guessing skills while providing feedback on whether to guess higher or lower with each attempt.
